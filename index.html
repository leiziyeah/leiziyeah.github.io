<h1 align="center">Think Different</h1>
<p align="center">Here's to the crazy ones.</p>
<p align="center">The misfits.</p>
<p align="center">The rebels.</p>
<p align="center">The troublemakers.</p>
<p align="center">The round pegs in the square holes.</p>
<p align="center">The ones who see things differently.</p>
<p align="center">They're not fond of rules.</p>
<p align="center">And they have no respect for the status quo.</p>
<p align="center">You can quote them,disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.</p>
<p align="center">About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.</p>
<p align="center">Because they change things.</p>
<p align="center">They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire.</p>
<p align="center">They push the human race forward.</p>
<p align="center">Maybe they have to be crazy.</p>
<p align="center">How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?</p>
<p align="center">Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?</p>
<p align="center">Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?</p>
<p align="center">We make tools for these kinds of people.</p>
<p align="center">While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</p>
<p align="center">Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>
